# User Service API

## Overview

This is a backend service for managing users and posts, built with Node.js and Sequelize. It provides RESTful APIs to create, read, update, and delete users and posts, as well as to handle tags and post-tag relationships. The service uses PostgreSQL as its database.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, update, delete, and search users.
- **Post Management**: Create, update, delete, and search posts.
- **Tag Management**: Create tags and associate them with posts.
- **Authentication**: Basic authentication setup (can be expanded based on requirements).

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Sequelize**: ORM for Node.js to interact with PostgreSQL.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database.
- **bcryptjs**: Library for hashing passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Library for handling JSON Web Tokens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed. Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running. You can download it from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-service.git
   cd user-service
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and create a database for the project.
   - Update the database configuration in `config/db.js` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

4. **Run database migrations**:

   Ensure your database schema is set up by running the migrations. This might involve manually creating tables using the provided `CREATE TABLE` commands or using a migration tool.

5. **Start the server**:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   The server will start and listen on port `3000` by default. You should see a message indicating that the server is running and that the database has been successfully synced.

## API Endpoints

### Users

- **Create User**: `POST /api/users`
- **Update User**: `PUT /api/users/:id`
- **Delete User**: `DELETE /api/users/:id`
- **List Users**: `GET /api/users`
- **Search User by Name**: `GET /api/users/search`

### Posts

- **Create Post**: `POST /api/posts`
- **Update Post**: `PUT /api/posts/:id`
- **Delete Post**: `DELETE /api/posts/:id`
- **List Posts by Tags**: `GET /api/posts/tags`
- **Search Posts by Text**: `GET /api/posts/search`

### Tags

- **Create Tag**: `POST /api/tags`
- **List Tags**: `GET /api/tags`

## Configuration

Update the `config/db.js` file to set your PostgreSQL database configuration:

```js
const sequelize = new Sequelize('connectify', 'project_server_mold_user', '5VoGoAT6VphhOx6PzqH3OzTeO3G6kbER', {
  host: 'dpg-cq1sbdbv2p9s73d7b3jg-a.oregon-postgres.render.com',
  dialect: 'postgres',
  logging: console.log,
  pool: {
    max: 10,
    min: 0,
    acquire: 30000,
    idle: 10000,
  },
});
```

## Testing

To test the API, you can use tools like Postman or cURL. Ensure that the server is running before testing the endpoints.
